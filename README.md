# Calculator
Online calculator that uses browser's runtime engine.

This is the last project under the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The calculator is made using HTML, vanilla CSS and JS. The UI was heavily inspired from <a href="https://github.com/michalosman">michalosman</a>'s <a href="https://michalosman.github.io/calculator/">submission</a>.

Lastly, you can watch this project's deployment on Github Pages <a href="https://malginisus.github.io/calculator/">here</a>.
